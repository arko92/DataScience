## Project planning

1. Develop a data-driven salary estimator for data analysts job profiles using data science techniques.
2. Collect and aggregate relevant salary data, including location, experience, education, and industry from glassdoor using web scrapping
3. Preprocess and clean the data to ensure quality and integrity.
4. Perform feature engineering to identify key factors influencing salaries.
5. Train a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
7. Build a user-friendly interface for users to input their details and receive salary estimates.
8. Conduct thorough testing and validation of the salary estimator.
9. Ensure accuracy and reliability of the estimator.
